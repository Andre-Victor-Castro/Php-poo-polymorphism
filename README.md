## Polymorphism
**Overview**: Enables objects to take different forms while sharing a common interface

**Key Aspects**:
- Runtime polymorphism (method overriding in inheritance)
- Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading in the same class)

**Advanced Concepts**:
- When to use overriding vs. overloading
- How polymorphism improves code flexibility in large systems
- Combining with interfaces for cleaner architecture
